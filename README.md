# Hey there!

I'm a materials and metallurgy engineering undergraduate student and I'm
currently studying front-end technologies. Kinda weird right? ðŸ˜…

I'm passionate in learning dev stuff, tho JS can be weird sometimes and CSS
makes me want to pull my hair out!

At the moment I'm building a solid foundation in ES6+ so I can benefit the most
from a framework.

Everyday is a good day to boost my neovim setup.

I hope we can get along! Let's build a better world for everyone! ðŸ’ª
