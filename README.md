# Hey there!

I'm a front-end web developer and I'm always on the lookout to learn something new!

I feel like I've finally tamed modern JavaScript, and nowadays I feel much more confortable with CSS although it still finds ways to bewilder me. ðŸ˜…

For the moment I'm coding âœ¨ Cool Stuffâ„¢ âœ¨ with the power of React, TypeScript and SASS.

Every now and then I boost my dotfiles in order to make my machine and my demands fit together like perfectly cut puzzle pieces âš¡âš¡

As everything else, It's a work in progress.

I hope we can get along! Let's build a better world for everyone! ðŸ’ª
